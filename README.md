# Turkcell Akıllı Su Ağı

Turkcell Akıllı Su Ağı is an AI-powered smart water loss and leakage detection system
designed for urban water distribution networks.

## Project Overview
Urban water loss and leakage cause significant environmental and economic damage.
This project proposes an intelligent decision support system that analyzes
real-time pressure and flow data collected from IoT sensors installed in water pipelines.

The system aims to detect anomalies, predict potential leakage points,
and provide early warnings before major infrastructure failures occur.

## Technologies (Planned)
- IoT Sensors (Pressure & Flow Monitoring)
- Machine Learning (Anomaly Detection)
- Cloud & Edge Computing
- Big Data Analytics
- Turkcell IoT Infrastructure (Conceptual Integration)

## Methodology
- Collect real-time sensor data from water distribution networks
- Analyze patterns using machine learning algorithms
- Identify abnormal pressure and flow behaviors
- Generate risk scores and early warnings for municipalities

## Project Status
This repository represents the conceptual system architecture
prepared for the Turkcell "Yarının Teknoloji Liderleri" competition.
Development and pilot implementation are planned for future phases.
